Js is single threaed 

for asynchronous it need browser support
callstack is inside js engine,js engine is inside window(browser tab).The has support of location,history,local storage,
Dom,..etc.These are access by global object.
js engine is immediately execute all the code inside callstack
for eg:
    if a setTimout is set for 5 sec

   * 1st js engine run any code in callstack if a setTimout is seen the bowser start timing.

   * if the timer is over then it push to callback queue.

   * event loop is a special one who continously checking the callback queue.

   * if any data in the callback queue and callstack is empty then it put inside the callstack ,then js engine execute it


like callback queue there is an another queue called microtask queue, 
it has higher priority then callback queue , promise and async/Await is goes to the microtask queue
Note : async/Await is a kind of promise.

event loop 1st check inside microtask queue if any data inside it event loop put 1st one on the callstack,
after execute the 1st task the callstack is empty then it put second,like wise it put one by one.

if callstack is empty and microtask queue is also empty then it  check in callback queue it put the function inside the queue one by one

Note :
promise's and mutation observer is goes inside microtask queue.
then other callbacks, Dom api,...ect are goes to callback queue

callback queue is also known as task queue
