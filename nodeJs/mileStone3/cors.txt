cors - cross origin resouce sharing
Before cors there was no resource share between different origin of web apps

now a days the big application are build into micro service and deployed into different servers.
so need of cors is very important(same application is splitted into smaller one and deployed seperately)

after standardize the cors the resource sharing is allowed

if 'a' want to communicate with 'b' means 
    1st a send and prefright call to b 
    b verify it then send options response the acknowledgement (options response has additional http headers )
    after receving the acknowledgement now a can share the resource
