Bluebird JS is a fully-featured Promise library for JavaScript. 
The strongest feature of Bluebird is that it allows you to “promisify” other Node modules in order to use them asynchronously. 
Promisify is a concept applied to callback functions.
This concept is used to ensure that every callback function which is called returns some value.

So if a NodeJS module contains a callback function which does not return a value, and if we Promisify the node module,
all the function’s in that specific node module would automatically be modified to ensure that it returns a value.
