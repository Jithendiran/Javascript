JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.

JWT is not for authendication is only for autherization.which means the user verification is alredy done and it is like a pass 

authendication is like login
autherization is verify the request from the same login user

after authendication from server the jwt is give to client for future communication,the jwt is sent in http header
eg:{Authorization:bearer Jwt}

every state is sent to the client by the server for future 

jwt has three parts,each part is seprated by '.'


1st part is 'payload'
    it is the json which need to exchange.it is surrounded by 2 parts

above payload is header
    it describes how this is signed it has feilds like type:JWT and algorith used for sign

below payload is signature
    this has the signature part server is validate the user by where the above given header and payload is correct or not
    the signature is only authendicated and recognized by the server

    the signature is generated by base64UrlEncode(header)+'.'+base64UrlEncode(payload),Your-256bit - secret key
