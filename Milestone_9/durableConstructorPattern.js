 * Durable Constructor Pattern 
 * 
 * it is an secure pattern
 * 
 * In a parasitic constructor pattern, you create a constructor function that creates an object and returns that object.
 * 
 * A durable object is an object that does not have public property and its methods donâ€™t reference to the this object.
 * The durable objects are often used in secure environments where accessing this and new are not allowed.
